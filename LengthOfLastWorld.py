# Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
# A word is a maximal 
# substring
#  consisting of non-space characters only.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        words = s.split()
        length = len(words[-1])
        return length
